# User Defined Data Type

Q) you need to store Data(cgpa,roll no, name) of 50 students?

soln) create you own datatype which is capable of storing 3 datatypes.

-- we cannot use array , since array stores elements of same datatype.

-- convention -> class name should start with capital Letter.

-- initialize/access class values using . operator;

-- we can use any datatype inside class.

-- we can also take input.

-- whenever we create a class , a capsule of that class is created .

-- inside that capsule we have memeory allocated for each data member/attribute that we have created inside the class.

# classes and Objects

-- class is a blueprint(collection of things/attributes).

-- object is an instance of a class.
-- every object will have it's own details/values assigned to its attributes.
-- but every object of the same class will follow the class blueprint.

-- we can create multiple classes.
